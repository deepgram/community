:wave: Hey, we're Deepgram! 
======


[Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) is a Speech Company whose goal is to have **every voice heard and understood**.  We've revolutionized speech-to-text (STT) with an End-to-End Deep Learning platform. This Artificial Intelligence architectural advantage means users donâ€™t have to compromise on speed, accuracy, scalability, or cost to build the next big idea in voice.   Our easy-to-use APIs allow developers to quickly test and embed our STT solution into their voice product or experience.
